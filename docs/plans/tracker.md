# Smart Sales Prism Tracker

> **Purpose**: Central project history and active epic tracking.
> **Operational Law**: No task is added to the Active Epic without a compiler error, a failing test, or a direct user command. The roadmap is adaptive but driven by evidence, not hallucination.
> **Rule**: History entries are commit-style — key info only.
> **Last Updated**: 2026-03-10

## 🚧 ACTIVE EPIC: The Great Assembly (Core to Outer Rim / Anti-Illusion Protocol)
> **Context**: We construct the system from the *Inside Out* (Kernel → RAM → SSD → App). Each ring must be physically decoupled and mathematically proven (Anti-Illusion Protocol) before the next ring is mounted. Mockito is evicted. 3-Level Testing (L1 Unit, L2 Sim, L3 Device) is strictly enforced.

### 💍 Ring 1: Layer 1 Infrastructure (Kernel Services)
> The raw I/O and hardware interaction layer. Must operate independently of all higher-level domain models.
- [x] **Extraction**: `:data:connectivity`, `:core:notifications`, `:data:asr`, `:data:tingwu`, `:core:telemetry`
- [x] **Verification**: All L1 tests pass. Independent contracts proven.

### 💍 Ring 2: Layer 2 Data Services (SSD & RAM)
> The memory and state layer. SSD (Room) and RAM (SessionWorkingSet) must be strictly decoupled. No internal tracking mutations allowed during Read.
- [x] **Domain Extraction**: Extract pure Kotlin contracts for `session` (STM), `memory` (LTM), `habit` (RL), `crm` (LTM).
- [x] **Persistence Isolation**: Extract `PrismDatabase` into `:core:database`. Wire concrete DAOs to feature data modules (`:data:habit`, `:data:memory`, etc.).
- [x] **Anti-Illusion Audit W1 (`session`)**: ✅ SHIPPED Ensure `SessionWorkingSet` RAM updates mathematically sync with `HistoryRepository` SSD writes. App-core double-write anomaly fixed and proven via `SessionAntiIllusionIntegrationTest`.
- [x] **Anti-Illusion Audit W2 (`memory/crm`)**: ✅ SHIPPED Enforce exact entity extraction/disambiguation mapping between raw Strings and `sealed class` domain representations.

### 💍 Ring 3: Layer 3 Core Pipeline (The Orchestrator)
> The brain. Connects user input to LLM mapping, then routes to physical features. Cannot invoke Fake/Dead logic.
- [x] **Physical Extraction**: `:core:llm`, `:core:context`, `:core:pipeline`. Solved circular dependencies and smart-casting traps.
- [x] **Mock Eviction W1 (Routing)**: ✅ SHIPPED Purge `mockito` intercepts from `RealUnifiedPipelineTest`. Inject `:core:test-fakes` to prove physical routing behavior (e.g., LightningFastTrack drops to Mascot vs deep Analyst loop).
- [x] **Context Branch Coverage W2**: ✅ SHIPPED Prove `RealContextBuilder` accurately toggles `ContextDepth` (Minimal vs Full) under load without out-of-memory or timeout illusions.
- [x] **Strict Interface Integrity W3**: ✅ SHIPPED Assert that `EntityDisambiguator` and `InputParser` accurately reject/clarify corrupted LLM JSON without hallucinating a successful pipeline emission.

### 💍 Ring 4: Layer 4 Features & UI (The Outer Rim)
> The App layer. The literal physical manifestation of the system. State emissions must translate 1:1 to UI visual updates.
- [x] **Dataflow Veracity W1 (`Scheduler`)**: ✅ SHIPPED Enforce `verify(mock).method(argThat { ... })` structure over all `ToolRegistry` and `SchedulerLinter` payloads.
- [x] **UI Literal Sync W2 (`AgentViewModel`)**: ✅ SHIPPED Prove the Orchestrator's `State` emissions (e.g., `ClarificationNeeded`) physically trigger the exact `prism-ui-ux-contract.md` Compose layouts, not invisible states masked by anti-patterns (e.g., Drawer Scrim).
- [ ] **3-Level Testing Validation W3 (L2 → L3)**: For any new UI flow, an explicit L2 Simulated test *must pass* before attempting an L3 manual physical device test.

## Tech Debt (Deferred for Beta)

| Item | Location | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| `delay()` in UI | `ResponseBubble.kt`, `ConnectivityModal.kt`, `OnboardingScreen.kt` | Low |
| FTS4 Search | `MemoryDao.kt` — LIKE for Chinese | Medium |
| Remaining Fakes | `FakeHistoryRepository`, `FakeAudioRepository` — not Room-backed | Low |
| TOCTOU in observe() | `RoomUserHabitRepository.kt` | Low |
| Room error handling | `Room*Repository` — no try-catch on writes | Low |
| **Confidence-Based Reminder Interceptor** | Replace deterministic round-1 wrap-up with LLM confidence-based interception. Agent decides when to surface schedule context. Requires classifier or LLM self-assessment of conversation intent. Current workaround: smarter prompting that lets LLM decide naturally. | Medium |
| ~~**L2 UI Verification**~~ | ~~`MarkdownStrategyBubble.kt` — Verify the title extraction and rendering styling (T2 test from `l2_test_plan.md`) after major component refactoring is complete.~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **Resolved** — L2 isolated UI injection built and verified via Debug HUD. Header parsing and styled layouts proven without Mockito. |
| ~~**NotificationService Layer Violation**~~ | ~~`NotificationService.kt` in `domain` imports `android.app.PendingIntent`~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **Resolved** — Ghost Debt. `PendingIntent` was previously abstracted into the pure Kotlin `NotificationAction` sealed class. Domain purity confirmed via grep audit. |
| **Phase 3 E2E Pillar Resumption (The 6 Waves)** | System-wide E2E Device Tests for: Lightning Fast-Track, Dual-Engine Bridge, Strict Interface Integrity, Adaptive Habit Loop, Efficiency Overload, Transparent Mind. Deferred until all inner rings (1-4) mathematically pass the Anti-Illusion protocol without Mockito. | High |

## Changelog

> Key spec/impl changes, newest first. Like `git log --oneline`.

### 2026-03-10
- **agent-intelligence-ui**: MarkdownStrategyBubble L2 Verification SHIPPED. Built an isolated L2 UI injection testing mechanism via `L2DebugHud` and `AgentViewModel.debugRunScenario()`. Fixed legacy `LiveArtifactBuilder` routing bug in `AgentChatScreen` and upgraded `MarkdownText.kt` to natively parse headers and lists. The UI now explicitly verifies title extraction and rendering styling without relying on LLM executor passes.
- **scheduler**: W1 Dataflow Veracity SHIPPED. Retrofitted `FakeToolRegistry` and `FakeExecutor` to track exact execution payloads (`executedRequests` and `executedPrompts`) natively without Mockito. Enforced explicit payload structure and Dataflow Context assertions in `AgentViewModelTest.kt` and `RealUnifiedPipelineTest.kt`, eliminating Testing Illusions in the scheduler pipeline.
- **architecture**: Tracker Philosophy SHIPPED. Established `tracker.md` as the "Master Status Ledger" and Active Epic scratchpad while deferring to `spec.md` for architectural contracts and `interface-map.md` for global topology. Enforced "Operational Law" requiring evidence for any tracker updates. Removed redundant `Cerb Spec Index`.
- **architecture**: Completed Phase 2 of Layer 4 Feature Sweeps. Relocated `SchedulerLinterTest` and `AlarmSchedulerTest` to `:domain:scheduler:test`. Evicted Mockito from `AgentViewModelTest` by generating and injecting pure test Fakes from `:core:test-fakes`. Verified via Acceptance Team testing (`FakeUnifiedPipeline`).
- **architecture**: Completed Phase 2 of Layer 3 Core Pipeline Purge. Refactored `InputParserService` & `EntityDisambiguator` to use native `:core:llm` `Executor` and evicted Mockito from `RealInputParserServiceTest.kt`. Validated via Acceptance Team testing (`FakeExecutor`).
- **architecture**: "New Assembly" Pivot DECLARED. Abandoned the original "Great Assembly" due to compiler-driven extraction causing hidden coupling (Layer 3 depending on Layer 1) and abandoned test files. Initiating a bottom-up Layer 2 rebuild enforcing the 4 Cerb Pillars (Feature Purity, Anti-Illusion Testing, UI Literal Sync, Observable Telemetry).

### 2026-03-09
- **architecture**: Testing Strategy Pivot SHIPPED. Formally paused the 'Great Assembly' at Layer 3 to prioritize the 'Anti-Illusion Test Overhaul' across the Core Pipeline. Mocks that bypass information gates have created a testing illusion, hiding critical routing defects. Future work will focus exclusively on Mock Eviction (Wave 2) and Context Branch Coverage (Wave 1).
- **agent-intelligence-ui**: Wave 2 SHIPPED — Successfully executed the "Nuke & Pave" refactor of the monolithic `PrismViewModel` into `AgentViewModel`. Completely decoupled Layer 3 AI routing logic out of the Presentation layer into a dedicated `:core:pipeline:IntentOrchestrator`. Physically eliminated `PrismShell`, `PrismChatScreen`, and `PrismMainActivity` in favor of their `Agent*` equivalents via AST manipulation. All tests pass, proving perfect routing encapsulation.
- **test-infrastructure**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Successfully extracted fragmented `Fake*Repository` classes (`FakeMemoryRepository`, `FakeEntityRepository`, `FakeUserHabitRepository`) out of the monolithic `app-core` test directory into a strictly isolated `:core:test-fakes` Gradle module. Purged hardcoded skeleton data to enforce the Clean Before Build Anti-Drift protocol. All consumers refactored and unit tests passed.

### 2026-03-07
- **architecture**: Layer 3 Core Pipeline Physical Extraction (Phase 2) SHIPPED — Physically extracted the Orchestrator, Context Builder, and LLM plugins from the `app-core` monolith into strictly isolated Gradle library modules (`:core:llm`, `:core:context`, `:core:pipeline`). Decoupled DashscopeExecutor constraints, repaired global Dagger bindings, and bridged cross-module Kotlin smart-casting limits. Verification passed perfectly.

### 2026-03-06
- **architecture**: Layer 2 Domain Modularization (Stage 2) SHIPPED — Extracted monolithic `PrismDatabase` and Room DAOs into a strictly decoupled `:core:database` module. Successfully moved and wired `RoomUserHabitRepository`, `RoomMemoryRepository`, and `RoomEntityRepository` to isolated `:data:habit`, `:data:memory`, and `:data:crm` feature data modules. Additionally, surgically extracted `RoomHistoryRepository` to `:data:session` to complete 100% of the Layer 2 Data Services assembly.
- **architecture**: The Great Renaming & OS Layer Standardization SHIPPED — Renamed the `app-core` prototype codename to `app-core` consistently across folders, `settings.gradle.kts`, and all documentation. Formally standardized the `docs/cerb/interface-map.md` OS Layer taxonomy to enforce a strict `OS: Kernel`, `OS: RAM`, `OS: SSD`, `OS: App` architecture definition.
- **architecture**: Layer 2 Domain Modularization (Stage 1) SHIPPED — Physically extracted pure Kotlin domain contracts for STM (`session`), LTM (`crm`, `memory`), and RL (`habit`) out of `app-core` into four distinct, isolated Gradle library modules. Passed rigorous Architectural Drift Audit mathematically proving strict one-way dependency isolation between SSD and RAM boundaries.
- **architecture**: The Great Assembly (Phase 1) SHIPPED — Extracted all 5 core Layer 1 Infrastructure modules from `app-core/domain` into physically isolated Gradle libraries (`:data:connectivity`, `:core:notifications`, `:data:asr`, `:data:tingwu`, `:core:telemetry`). Passed strict Acceptance Team build & contract verification.
- **architecture**: Finalized "Analyst Mode" sunsetting. Removed ghost "Analyst pending" tech debt from M3 milestone goals in favor of tracking actual Unified Pipeline blockers. Synced `plugin-registry` spec state to **SHIPPED** (Wave 4 Async Execution Wiring was previously implemented natively). Confirmed `audio-management` (Wave 2) is the true remaining blocker for full operational parity.
- **agent-intelligence-ui**: Spec Created — Added dual-document specs (`spec.md` and `interface.md`) in new `docs/cerb-ui/` hierarchy. Strictly enforced "Dumb UI" and absolute decoupling from ViewModel and Plugins.
- **input-parser**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Refactored `SessionTitleGenerator` to `SemanticSessionTitleGenerator`, removing redundant LLM calls. Name and temporal intent are now synchronously extracted from `InputParserService` JSON and routed natively via `PipelineResult.AutoRenameTriggered`. Proven bypass logic where Mascot `NOISE`/`GREETING` intents correctly avoid the trigger entirely.

### 2026-03-05
- **architecture**: Comprehensive Interface Map Audit SHIPPED — Identified extensive signature drift across 17 modules and corrected `interface-map.md` to reflect exact Kotlin boundaries. Downgraded `RLModule` from SHIPPED to PARTIAL (Fake masquerade). Flagged `NotificationService` domain-layer Android import rule violation.
- **infra**: Fixed missing `UnifiedPipeline` constructor binding in `PrismModule` which broke L2 simulation testing.
- **oss-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Passed Anti-Laziness testing gates by implementing unit tests with simulated Dashscope/Aliyun API failures (`RealOssUploaderTest`).
- **asr-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Passed Anti-Laziness testing gates by implementing comprehensive L1 unit tests (`FunAsrServiceTest`).

- **mascot-service**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Integrated Compose UI `MascotOverlay` out-of-band in `AgentShell`.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 3 SHIPPED — Wired Mascot EventBus to `AgentViewModel` AppIdle trigger.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 2 SHIPPED (Basic Routing and Intent disambiguation). `LightningRouter` now distinguishes between `NOISE` and `GREETING` and routes both to Mascot, while correctly routing `VAGUE` to the persistent Analyst flow.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — `MascotService` interface and `FakeMascotService` prototype formally integrated and wired into dependency injection. Spec upgraded to PARTIAL state.
- **architecture**: Wave 5 Dual-Engine Architecture SHIPPED. Established "Mascot (System I)" vs "Prism Orchestrator (System II)" boundary.
  - Mascot handles ephemeral notifications/greetings out-of-band. OS Toasts remain the source of truth for reliable system state.
  - Orchestrator uses the Analyze Gateway to launch Plugins (e.g., Talk Simulator).
- **mascot-service**: Interface + Fakes SHIPPED to track System I out-of-band EventBus capabilities.
- **lightning-router**: Phase 0 Nuke and Pave SHIPPED. Extracted from Analyst Pipeline and elevated to PrismOrchestrator. Intercepts intents and routes NOISE/GREETING to System I, DEEP_ANALYSIS to System II.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 2/4 SHIPPED (Fast Track Refinement) — Implemented exact spec "Open-Loop Lifecycle", routing `SIMPLE_QA` Consultant intents directly to `IDLE` with immediate answers, bypassing the `PROPOSAL` and `INVESTIGATING` states. Validated with `FakeAnalystPipeline` simulation.

### 2026-03-03
- **entity-disambiguation**: W1-3 SHIPPED — `EntityDisambiguator` Global Gateway implemented. Intercept & Resume loop successfully wired into `PrismOrchestrator` and `AnalystPipeline`. LLM semantic disambiguation and explicit entity declarations gracefully route to `EntityWriter`.
- **session-context**: W4 OS Model Refinement — Implemented Delta Loading Entity Cache (`entityCache` Map) in `SessionWorkingSet` and `RealContextBuilder`. Fixed infinite pipeline loops and redundant SSD queries.
- **session-context**: W5 SHIPPED — Context Compression / Lazy Loading implemented via `ContextDepth` enum in `ContextBuilder`. Eliminates full DB and Habitat loads for NOISE/QA intents.
- **analyst-consultant**: W4 SHIPPED — Lightning Router utilizes `ContextDepth.MINIMAL` in `RealAnalystPipeline`, passing through the fast Extractor model and avoiding heavy token footprints.
- **audio-management**: Ask AI Dataflow Verification — Reworked "Ask AI" entrance. Implemented zero-latency ASCII overview card generation, standard `Mode.ANALYST` routing, and invisible `documentContext` binding in `SessionWorkingSet` to offload heavy payload rendering from the UI.

### 2026-03-02
- **entity-writer**: W5 SHIPPED — Audited `upsertFromClue` Resolution Cascade (`resolvedId` → `findByAlias` → `findByDisplayName`), which is organically functioning correctly and conforms to the `InputParser`'s upstream LLM entity resolution payload contract. All existing 18 unit tests verified and passed.
- **pipeline-telemetry**: W1-W2 SHIPPED — `PipelineTelemetry` abstracted and injected into `PrismOrchestrator`, `RealContextBuilder`, and `RealInputParserService`. Granular Tagging implemented to perfectly map the Layer 2 & Layer 3 architecture diagram into ADB logcat output.
- **infra**: Holistic Cleanup SHIPPED — Purged dead Analyst routing from Orchestrator, fixed ContextBuilder `structuredJson` schema drift (Activity records), and removed dead `httpChecker` from Connectivity. Fixed tech debt ticking time-bombs.

### 2026-02-27
- **audio-management**: Wave 2 partial — Implemented `RealAudioRepository` with file storage, wired `TingwuPipeline`, and added Fake Streaming (Typewriter effect / Shimmer loading) to Audio UI.
- **tingwu-pipeline**: Decoupled legacy Tingwu API into Prism domain feature.

### 2026-02-25
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 3 & 5 SHIPPED 🎯 Extracted consultant logic, transitioned state to PROPOSAL without `PlannerTable`, and wired `EntityResolverService` disambiguation loops natively into `handleInput`.
- **analyst-consultant**: Wave 3 SHIPPED 🎯 Formalized `ConsultantResult` to correctly extract `missingEntities` and provide raw clarifying text.
- **tingwu-pipeline**: Wave 1-4 SHIPPED 🎯 Decoupled Tingwu API from legacy ai-core into a clean Prism Feature. Wired Real/Fake pipelines to AudioRepository.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Domain models, FakeAnalystPipeline L2 simulator, wiring with AgentViewModel, and verification tests passing.

### 2026-02-14
- **session-history**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Auto-Renaming (`SessionTitleGenerator`, `LlmSessionTitleGenerator`, PrismVM trigger on first response, horizontal HistoryDrawer layout)
- **infra**: Added `mockito-core` + `mockito-kotlin` to `libs.versions.toml` and `app-core/build.gradle.kts`
