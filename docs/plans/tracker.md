## Changelog

> Key spec/impl changes, newest first. Like `git log --oneline`.

### 2026-03-10

- **architecture**: "New Assembly" Pivot DECLARED. Abandoned the original "Great Assembly" due to compiler-driven extraction causing hidden coupling (Layer 3 depending on Layer 1) and abandoned test files. Initiating a bottom-up Layer 2 rebuild enforcing the 4 Cerb Pillars (Feature Purity, Anti-Illusion Testing, UI Literal Sync, Observable Telemetry).
- **docs**: Deprecated `prism-ui-ux-contract.md`. The Single Source of Truth for UI/UX is now exclusively the `docs/cerb/[feature]/spec.md` files to prevent multi-spec architectural drift.

### 2026-03-09
- **architecture**: Testing Strategy Pivot SHIPPED. Formally paused the 'Great Assembly' at Layer 3 to prioritize the 'Anti-Illusion Test Overhaul' across the Core Pipeline. Mocks that bypass information gates have created a testing illusion, hiding critical routing defects. Future work will focus exclusively on Mock Eviction (Wave 2) and Context Branch Coverage (Wave 1).

- **agent-intelligence-ui**: Wave 2 SHIPPED — Successfully executed the "Nuke & Pave" refactor of the monolithic `PrismViewModel` into `AgentViewModel`. Completely decoupled Layer 3 AI routing logic out of the Presentation layer into a dedicated `:core:pipeline:IntentOrchestrator`. Physically eliminated `PrismShell`, `PrismChatScreen`, and `PrismMainActivity` in favor of their `Agent*` equivalents via AST manipulation. All tests pass, proving perfect routing encapsulation.
- **test-infrastructure**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Successfully extracted fragmented `Fake*Repository` classes (`FakeMemoryRepository`, `FakeEntityRepository`, `FakeUserHabitRepository`) out of the monolithic `app-core` test directory into a strictly isolated `:core:test-fakes` Gradle module. Purged hardcoded skeleton data to enforce the Clean Before Build Anti-Drift protocol. All consumers refactored and unit tests passed.

### 2026-03-07

- **architecture**: Layer 3 Core Pipeline Physical Extraction (Phase 2) SHIPPED — Physically extracted the Orchestrator, Context Builder, and LLM plugins from the `app-core` monolith into strictly isolated Gradle library modules (`:core:llm`, `:core:context`, `:core:pipeline`). Decoupled DashscopeExecutor constraints, repaired global Dagger bindings, and bridged cross-module Kotlin smart-casting limits. Verification passed perfectly.

### 2026-03-06

- **architecture**: Layer 2 Domain Modularization (Stage 2) SHIPPED — Extracted monolithic `PrismDatabase` and Room DAOs into a strictly decoupled `:core:database` module. Successfully moved and wired `RoomUserHabitRepository`, `RoomMemoryRepository`, and `RoomEntityRepository` to isolated `:data:habit`, `:data:memory`, and `:data:crm` feature data modules. Additionally, surgically extracted `RoomHistoryRepository` to `:data:session` to complete 100% of the Layer 2 Data Services assembly.
- **architecture**: The Great Renaming & OS Layer Standardization SHIPPED — Renamed the `app-core` prototype codename to `app-core` consistently across folders, `settings.gradle.kts`, and all documentation. Formally standardized the `docs/cerb/interface-map.md` OS Layer taxonomy to enforce a strict `OS: Kernel`, `OS: RAM`, `OS: SSD`, `OS: App` architecture definition.

- **architecture**: Layer 2 Domain Modularization (Stage 1) SHIPPED — Physically extracted pure Kotlin domain contracts for STM (`session`), LTM (`crm`, `memory`), and RL (`habit`) out of `app-core` into four distinct, isolated Gradle library modules. Passed rigorous Architectural Drift Audit mathematically proving strict one-way dependency isolation between SSD and RAM boundaries.
- **architecture**: The Great Assembly (Phase 1) SHIPPED — Extracted all 5 core Layer 1 Infrastructure modules from `app-core/domain` into physically isolated Gradle libraries (`:data:connectivity`, `:core:notifications`, `:data:asr`, `:data:tingwu`, `:core:telemetry`). Passed strict Acceptance Team build & contract verification.

- **architecture**: Finalized "Analyst Mode" sunsetting. Removed ghost "Analyst pending" tech debt from M3 milestone goals in favor of tracking actual Unified Pipeline blockers. Synced `plugin-registry` spec state to **SHIPPED** (Wave 4 Async Execution Wiring was previously implemented natively). Confirmed `audio-management` (Wave 2) is the true remaining blocker for full operational parity.
- **agent-intelligence-ui**: Spec Created — Added dual-document specs (`spec.md` and `interface.md`) in new `docs/cerb-ui/` hierarchy. Strictly enforced "Dumb UI" and absolute decoupling from ViewModel and Plugins.
- **input-parser**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Refactored `SessionTitleGenerator` to `SemanticSessionTitleGenerator`, removing redundant LLM calls. Name and temporal intent are now synchronously extracted from `InputParserService` JSON and routed natively via `PipelineResult.AutoRenameTriggered`. Proven bypass logic where Mascot `NOISE`/`GREETING` intents correctly avoid the trigger entirely.

### 2026-03-05

- **architecture**: Comprehensive Interface Map Audit SHIPPED — Identified extensive signature drift across 17 modules and corrected `interface-map.md` to reflect exact Kotlin boundaries. Downgraded `RLModule` from SHIPPED to PARTIAL (Fake masquerade). Flagged `NotificationService` domain-layer Android import rule violation.

- **infra**: Fixed missing `UnifiedPipeline` constructor binding in `PrismModule` which broke L2 simulation testing.
- **oss-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Passed Anti-Laziness testing gates by implementing unit tests with simulated Dashscope/Aliyun API failures (`RealOssUploaderTest`).
- **asr-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Passed Anti-Laziness testing gates by implementing comprehensive L1 unit tests (`FunAsrServiceTest`).

### 2026-03-04

- **analyst-orchestrator**: Dual-Engine UI Alignment SHIPPED. Completely removed legacy `Mode.COACH` enum, UI toggles, and Switchers.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Analyst Pipeline State Machine Ghost State FIX. Wired session switches to automatically call `AnalystPipeline.reset()`.
- **plugin-registry**: Wave 1-4 COMPLETED — RealToolRegistry, flow execution, structure plugins.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 6 SHIPPED — Analyze Gateway & Plugin Routing (Expert Bypass) implemented. `RealArchitectService` now dynamically injects `ToolRegistry` into the Planning phase to strictly enforce tool execution boundaries via `PlanResult.ExpertBypass`.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 3 SHIPPED (EventBus Integration and AppIdle Latch).
- **mascot-service**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Integrated Compose UI `MascotOverlay` out-of-band in `AgentShell`.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 3 SHIPPED — Wired Mascot EventBus to `AgentViewModel` AppIdle trigger.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 2 SHIPPED (Basic Routing and Intent disambiguation). `LightningRouter` now distinguishes between `NOISE` and `GREETING` and routes both to Mascot, while correctly routing `VAGUE` to the persistent Analyst flow.
- **mascot-service**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — `MascotService` interface and `FakeMascotService` prototype formally integrated and wired into dependency injection. Spec upgraded to PARTIAL state.
- **architecture**: Wave 5 Dual-Engine Architecture SHIPPED. Established "Mascot (System I)" vs "Prism Orchestrator (System II)" boundary.
  - Mascot handles ephemeral notifications/greetings out-of-band. OS Toasts remain the source of truth for reliable system state.
  - Orchestrator uses the Analyze Gateway to launch Plugins (e.g., Talk Simulator).
- **mascot-service**: Interface + Fakes SHIPPED to track System I out-of-band EventBus capabilities.
- **lightning-router**: Phase 0 Nuke and Pave SHIPPED. Extracted from Analyst Pipeline and elevated to PrismOrchestrator. Intercepts intents and routes NOISE/GREETING to System I, DEEP_ANALYSIS to System II.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 2/4 SHIPPED (Fast Track Refinement) — Implemented exact spec "Open-Loop Lifecycle", routing `SIMPLE_QA` Consultant intents directly to `IDLE` with immediate answers, bypassing the `PROPOSAL` and `INVESTIGATING` states. Validated with `FakeAnalystPipeline` simulation.

### 2026-03-03

- **entity-disambiguation**: W1-3 SHIPPED — `EntityDisambiguator` Global Gateway implemented. Intercept & Resume loop successfully wired into `PrismOrchestrator` and `AnalystPipeline`. LLM semantic disambiguation and explicit entity declarations gracefully route to `EntityWriter`.
- **session-context**: W4 OS Model Refinement — Implemented Delta Loading Entity Cache (`entityCache` Map) in `SessionWorkingSet` and `RealContextBuilder`. Fixed infinite pipeline loops and redundant SSD queries.
- **session-context**: W5 SHIPPED — Context Compression / Lazy Loading implemented via `ContextDepth` enum in `ContextBuilder`. Eliminates full DB and Habitat loads for NOISE/QA intents.
- **analyst-consultant**: W4 SHIPPED — Lightning Router utilizes `ContextDepth.MINIMAL` in `RealAnalystPipeline`, passing through the fast Extractor model and avoiding heavy token footprints.
- **audio-management**: Ask AI Dataflow Verification — Reworked "Ask AI" entrance. Implemented zero-latency ASCII overview card generation, standard `Mode.ANALYST` routing, and invisible `documentContext` binding in `SessionWorkingSet` to offload heavy payload rendering from the UI.

### 2026-03-02

- **entity-writer**: W5 SHIPPED — Audited `upsertFromClue` Resolution Cascade (`resolvedId` → `findByAlias` → `findByDisplayName`), which is organically functioning correctly and conforms to the `InputParser`'s upstream LLM entity resolution payload contract. All existing 18 unit tests verified and passed.

- **pipeline-telemetry**: W1-W2 SHIPPED — `PipelineTelemetry` abstracted and injected into `PrismOrchestrator`, `RealContextBuilder`, and `RealInputParserService`. Granular Tagging implemented to perfectly map the Layer 2 & Layer 3 architecture diagram into ADB logcat output.

- **infra**: Holistic Cleanup SHIPPED — Purged dead Analyst routing from Orchestrator, fixed ContextBuilder `structuredJson` schema drift (Activity records), and removed dead `httpChecker` from Connectivity. Fixed tech debt ticking time-bombs.
### 2026-02-27

- **audio-management**: Wave 2 partial — Implemented `RealAudioRepository` with file storage, wired `TingwuPipeline`, and added Fake Streaming (Typewriter effect / Shimmer loading) to Audio UI.
- **tingwu-pipeline**: Decoupled legacy Tingwu API into Prism domain feature.

### 2026-02-25

- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 3 & 5 SHIPPED 🎯 Extracted consultant logic, transitioned state to PROPOSAL without `PlannerTable`, and wired `EntityResolverService` disambiguation loops natively into `handleInput`.
- **analyst-consultant**: Wave 3 SHIPPED 🎯 Formalized `ConsultantResult` to correctly extract `missingEntities` and provide raw clarifying text.
- **tingwu-pipeline**: Wave 1-4 SHIPPED 🎯 Decoupled Tingwu API from legacy ai-core into a clean Prism Feature. Wired Real/Fake pipelines to AudioRepository.
- **analyst-orchestrator**: Wave 1 SHIPPED — Domain models, FakeAnalystPipeline L2 simulator, wiring with AgentViewModel, and verification tests passing.

### 2026-02-14

- **session-history**: Wave 4 SHIPPED — Auto-Renaming (`SessionTitleGenerator`, `LlmSessionTitleGenerator`, PrismVM trigger on first response, horizontal HistoryDrawer layout)
- **infra**: Added `mockito-core` + `mockito-kotlin` to `libs.versions.toml` and `app-core/build.gradle.kts`

### 2026-02-13

- **entity-writer**: Wave 1.5 UNWINDING resolved — Sticky Notes abandoned, Scheduler is permanent caller
- **scheduler**: Wave 9 SHIPPED — Smart Tips (TipGenerator, LlmTipGenerator, ViewModel lazy-load, shimmer/bubble UI)
- **coach**: Sticky Notes integration — `ScheduledTaskRepository` injected into ContextBuilder, top 3 tasks as greeting context

- **mascot-service**: Spec updated — dependency table + pipeline flow + §3.6 documented
- **session-context**: `scheduleContext` field added to `SessionWorkingSet` spec model
- **scheduler**: Wave 8 amendment — Real-time alarm-fire reflection via `SchedulerRefreshBus` (DEADLINE alarm → ViewModel sweep → instant UI update)
- **scheduler**: Auto-expiry refined — 4 trigger points (init, drawer open, day switch, alarm fire), removed redundant sweeps from `triggerRefresh()`
- **scheduler**: FIRE_OFF duration fix — LLM prompt now requires `duration: null` for instant reminders (was incorrectly assigning 5m)
- **mascot-service**: Output Quality hardened (4-Layer Fix) — Plain text system prompt (no `##`), `<KNOWN_FACTS>` data envelope, Positive-only hallucination guard, `MarkdownSanitizer` safety net. Fixed "delivery cycle sensitivity" hallucination.

### 2026-02-12

- **scheduler**: Task Completion Lifecycle section — isDone toggle, grey/strikethrough, voice scope exclusion, alarm lifecycle, reactivation safety
- **scheduler**: Wave 12 planned — ViewModel toggleDone wiring + alarm cancel/restore on completion
- **scheduler**: Voice Command Scope section — 5 classifications, scheduler-mode + active-session only, card-context-free
- **scheduler**: Wave 8 — Auto-expiry: `autoCompleteExpiredTasks()` on ViewModel init, sweeps today's expired tasks. Debt: multi-day sweep, visual distinction manual vs auto

## Tech Debt (Deferred for Beta)

| Item | Location | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| `delay()` in UI | `ResponseBubble.kt`, `ConnectivityModal.kt`, `OnboardingScreen.kt` | Low |
| FTS4 Search | `MemoryDao.kt` — LIKE for Chinese | Medium |
| Remaining Fakes | `FakeHistoryRepository`, `FakeAudioRepository` — not Room-backed | Low |
| TOCTOU in observe() | `RoomUserHabitRepository.kt` | Low |
| Room error handling | `Room*Repository` — no try-catch on writes | Low |
| ~~Dead `httpChecker`~~ | ~~`DefaultDeviceConnectionManager.kt`~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✅ **Resolved** — Deleted interface and removed Dagger bindings. |
| ~~`structuredJson` schema inconsistency~~ | ~~`RealContextBuilder.recordActivity()`~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✅ **Resolved** — Updated schema to include both `relatedEntityIds` array and scalar `entityId`. |
| ~~Sticky Notes Boundary~~ | ~~`PrismOrchestrator.createScheduledTask()` calls `entityWriter.upsertFromClue()`~~ | ~~**High**~~ | ✅ **Resolved** — Sticky Notes abandoned. Scheduler creates PERSON + ACCOUNT entities for business-relevant contacts (Wave 10 SHIPPED). |
| **Confidence-Based Reminder Interceptor** | Replace deterministic round-1 wrap-up with LLM confidence-based interception. Agent decides when to surface schedule context: (1) User greets/noise → inject, (2) User discusses agenda → inject, (3) User wraps up work → suggest completion. Requires classifier or LLM self-assessment of conversation intent. Current workaround: smarter prompting that lets LLM decide naturally. | Medium |
| **L2 UI Verification** | `MarkdownStrategyBubble.kt` — Verify the title extraction and rendering styling (T2 test from `l2_test_plan.md`) after major component refactoring is complete. | High |
| **NotificationService Layer Violation** | `NotificationService.kt` in `domain` imports `android.app.PendingIntent` | High |

---

## Tech Debt: The Anti-Illusion Test Overhaul

> **Context**: See `anti-illusion-protocol.md`. Tests were mocking happy paths and ignoring pipeline information gates (Context Sufficiency). We need to overhaul tests to reflect reality.

| Overhaul Wave | Description | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Wave 1: Context Branch Coverage** | Audit `RealUnifiedPipelineTest` and `RealAnalystPipelineTest`. Enforce testing of all Enum branches (`CRM_TASK`, `NOISE`, `GREETING`, `VAGUE`) to verify proper routing. | 🔲 |
| **Wave 2: Complete Mock Eviction** | Purge lazy `whenever(repo.something()).thenReturn()` calls from all `*Test.kt` files. Replace with rigorous `Fake*Repository` implementations that enforce state integrity. | 🔲 |
| **Wave 3: The Verification Rule** | Enforce `verify(mock).method(argThat { ... })` across all tests when a downstream service is invoked. Never assert success without proving the correct data payload was sent. | 🔲 |

## The New Assembly (Layer 2 Upward Rebuild)

> **Phase Context**: **ACTIVE (2026-03-10)**. The original 'Great Assembly' was declared bankrupt due to compiler-driven extraction causing severe Layer 3/Layer 1 coupling and abandoned tests. We are restarting the assembly from Layer 2 marching upwards. 
> 
> **The 4 Cerb Pillars Gate:** Every module must pass this gate before moving up:
> 1. **Feature Purity**: Strict `interface-map.md` compliance. Zero illegal imports (e.g. Domain cannot see Android/Platform).
> 2. **Anti-Illusion Testing (L1/L2)**: Verified exclusively with physical `Fake` implementations to prove real data flow. No Mockito for internal state.
> 3. **UI Contract Literal Sync**: `/06-audit` literal match against Cerb specs. No synonyms.
> 4. **Observable Telemetry**: All phase emissions logged to ADB.
